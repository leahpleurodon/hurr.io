## Retrospective

I think the permissions could be built out a lot nicer than they currently are, perhaps by extracting them out into a service of their own.

I would have also liked to have more meaningful errors rather than just the standard error or a redirect.

More extraction of my logic would have also been nice given the time.

I need to work on my CSS/ design skills.
